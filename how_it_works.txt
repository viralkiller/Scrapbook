Nodes-GPT Overview (Plain Text):

4 Node Types:

Master Nodes:
Input Prompt (has one output) and Output Data (has one input).
Always visible and resizable.
A valid chain flows from Input Prompt through nodes to Output Data.
(Future enhancement: merge outputs from multiple nodes.)
Default Nodes:

Pre-built nodes such as Ask Question, Analyze Image, Generate Image, Email Me, and Art Styles.
Their toolbar icons are fixed and cannot be deleted.

Instance Nodes:
Created by cloning (using Ctrl+click).
Useful when combining outputs from different sources (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude).
Their palette icons include a trash icon for deletion.

Custom Nodes:
Added via the “+ Custom Node” button.
Similar to default nodes but allow user-defined titles and descriptions.
Their palette icons include a trash icon for deletion.

Line Creation:
Lines can only be made from an output port to an input port.
They are created by dragging from a port; if not finalized on a valid target, the line is removed.
Double-clicking a port deletes any attached lines.
The logic is minimal and scalable regardless of the drawing order.

Node Dragging:
Nodes can be moved, but they cannot be dragged off-screen.
The expanded view of custom nodes is also constrained to remain on-screen.

How credits are deducted:
Just like most LLM API models, we charge a base cost once + (cost per token * number of input tokens) + (cost per token * number of output tokens)
_Chain_Processor.py will check to see whether the user has enough credits to run the node chain before execution. Once executed they will be charged again for the output tokens.
However we only check: base cost once + (cost per token * number of input tokens) before allowing them to execute the chain, as we don't know how many output tokens
will be given by the API model. If it goes over, we will absorb these costs, but obviously take any remaining credits they have.

Microservices:

LoginManager: Manages authentication, registration, and credits.
AIManager: Provides AI responses using multiple language models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
ConvertManager: Handles image and document conversions.
EmailGateway: Manages email sending.

static/json/node_config.json contains the master node configurations, creating a user account copies this template. Here is an example:

Explanation of Specific Properties:

input_conns_allowed: 0
This means the node does not accept any incoming connections. (Typically used for the starting node, e.g., "Input Prompt".)

output_conns_allowed: -1
A value of -1 indicates an unlimited number of outgoing connections. (The node can send its output to as many nodes as needed.)

instances_allowed: 0
This means no duplicate instances of this node type are allowed. (Master nodes usually are unique and should not be cloned.)
